Spam Detector Project
About the Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for building and comparing two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. The models are trained and tested using a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The purpose of the project is to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their features.

Code Attribution and Sources
The code in this repository has been authored and assembled by me with the following considerations:

Dataset:

Dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The data file was retrieved from the link provided in the curriculum:
Spam Data CSV.
Code Contributions:

Portions of the machine learning code (e.g., data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation) have been informed by content learned in the curriculum and general Python machine learning practices.
Guidance for completing this notebook has been provided by support staff and online AI resources like ChatGPT for clarifying certain steps.
External Code:

No code from forums, such as Stack Overflow, or third-party repositories has been directly copied into this project without modification or attribution.
